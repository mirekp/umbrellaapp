# umbrellaapp

This is a simple Weather App for iOS implemented in Swift 2.0. Not many features. Just shows the weather + forecast at your location when opened.

Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/mirekp/umbrellaapp.git`

General notes

- This is a simple sample code.
- Runs on iOS 9.0 and up (due to using UIStackView and convenient single-shot requestLocation() API )
- 100% Swift code. Should compile fine in Xcode 7.2.1 against iOS 9.2 SDK
- the app needs location services permission and network access to work
